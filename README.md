# Swerve-Template

Some template code we wrote for a 4 pod Swerve Drive. This code has been written for Falcons and some other assumed constants, and has not been prepared as a general template for other teams. Development is still ongoing, and our most recent changes have been in the Auto branch.

## Getting Started

```sh
# If you have access to the frc2468 gitlab instance

# And if you don't
git clone https://github.com/frc2468/swerve-template.git

# Update necessary submodules
git submodule update --init

# To switch branches

cd swerve
git checkout Auto
```
