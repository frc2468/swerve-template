# Swerve-Template

Some template code we wrote for a 4 pod Swerve Drive. This code has been written for Falcons and some other assumed constants, and has not been prepared as a general template for other teams. Development is still ongoing, and our most recent changes have been in the Auto branch.

## Getting Started

```sh
# If you have access to the frc2468 gitlab instance
https://eisd-robotics.eanesisd.net/Abhi/swerve-template

# And if you don't
git clone https://github.com/frc2468/swerve-template.git

# Update necessary submodules
git submodule update --init

# To switch branches
git checkout <enter branch name>
cd swerve
git checkout <enter branch name>

# To update the repository in the future
git pull --recurse-submodules
git submodule update --recursive
```
